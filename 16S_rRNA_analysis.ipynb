            "Wrapper for full PICRUSt2 pipeline to be run with two different domains. This is intended for use with the new separate bacteria and archaea trees and reference trait tables. Run sequence placement with EPA-NG and GAPPA to place study sequences (i.e. OTUs and ASVs) into a reference tree. Then runs hidden-state prediction with the castor R package to predict NSTI and marker gene copy number for each study sequence. The domain that best fits each study sequence will then be chosen and hidden-state prediction with the castor R package will be used to predict traits for each genome. Predicted traits for all genomes are combined for both domains Metagenome profiles are then generated, which can be optionally stratified by the contributing sequence. Finally, pathway abundances are predicted based on metagenome profiles. By default, output files include predictions for Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers, KEGG Orthologs (KOs), and MetaCyc pathway abundances. However, this script enables users to use custom reference and trait tables to customize analyses. If you wish to run the previous version of PICRUSt2 (i.e. a single reference for all prokaryotes, please use the picrust2_pipeline.py script. This version was designed for running the separate bacterial and archaeal trees, but could be used for any two domains. If you know that your study sequences only contain bacteria, or only contain archaea, you may wish to run the picrust2_pipeline.py script but specifying bacteria/archaea as the reference database to use.\n",
